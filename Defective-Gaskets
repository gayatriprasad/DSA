Question

Suppose you're working in a parts manufacturing plant, and you're running quality analysis on the gasket production line. Gaskets produced by your company will be defective 1% of the time, and are distributed in packs of 20.

Your company has a policy where if 2 or more of the 20 gaskets in a given pack is defective, they will replace the entire package. What proportion of packages does the company need to replace?

To solve this problem, we need to use probability theory, specifically the binomial distribution. Let's break it down step by step:

First, let's identify the key information:

The probability of a single gasket being defective is 1% (0.01)
Each package contains 20 gaskets
The company replaces a package if it contains 2 or more defective gaskets


We need to find the probability of having 2 or more defective gaskets in a package of 20.
It's easier to calculate the probability of having 0 or 1 defective gasket and then subtract this from 1 to get the probability of 2 or more defectives.
Let's use the binomial probability formula:
P(X = k) = C(n,k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)
where n is the number of trials (20 in this case),
k is the number of successes (defectives),
p is the probability of success (0.01 in this case)
Probability of 0 defectives:
P(X = 0) = C(20,0) * 0.01^0 * 0.99^20 ≈ 0.8179
Probability of 1 defective:
P(X = 1) = C(20,1) * 0.01^1 * 0.99^19 ≈ 0.1652
Probability of 0 or 1 defective:
P(X ≤ 1) = 0.8179 + 0.1652 = 0.9831
Therefore, the probability of 2 or more defectives:
P(X ≥ 2) = 1 - P(X ≤ 1) = 1 - 0.9831 = 0.0169

So, the company needs to replace approximately 1.69% of the packages.
