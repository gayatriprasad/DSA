Problem

A given car has a number of miles it can run before its battery is depleted, where the number of miles are exponentially distributed with an average of 10,000 miles to depletion.

If a given individual needs to make a trip that's 3,000 miles, what is the probability that she/he will be able to complete the trip without having to replace the battery? You can assume the car battery is new for this problem.


Let's approach this problem step by step:

First, recall that for an exponential distribution, the probability density function is:
f(x) = λe^(-λx), where λ is the rate parameter.
We're given that the average (mean) of the distribution is 10,000 miles. For an exponential distribution, the mean is equal to 1/λ. So:
1/λ = 10,000
λ = 1/10,000 = 0.0001
We want to find the probability that the car can run for at least 3,000 miles. This is equivalent to finding the probability that the battery depletion occurs after 3,000 miles.
For an exponential distribution, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) gives the probability that the event occurs before a certain point. We want the opposite of this, which is given by the survival function:
S(x) = P(X > x) = e^(-λx)
Plugging in our values:
P(X > 3000) = e^(-0.0001 * 3000)
= e^(-0.3)
Let's calculate this:
e^(-0.3) ≈ 0.7408

Therefore, the probability that the individual will be able to complete the 3,000-mile trip without having to replace the battery is approximately 0.7408 or about 74.08%.
