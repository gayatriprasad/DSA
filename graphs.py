#### Graphs are representation of Nodes/Vertices and Edges 

### We can represent a graph as adjacent matrix or adjacent list 

#### adjacent matrix dimensions are equal to number of edges ( n edges - n*n matrix ) 

### For adjacent matrix representation we need the edges to be integers or mapped to integers

#### Another represetation is adjacent list 

### Node : Key, Neighbours : Values

## Time complexity : O(E+V) for both BFS and DFS 

### BFS is same as Level Order Traversal for trees 

#### Tree is a graph that is undirected and no cycles
